Tuxedo/Admin version 0.08
=========================

This module aims to make runtime administration of a Tuxedo environment
simpler and less error-prone than the usual method of navigating the tmadmin,
dmadmin and qmadmin menus or writing multiple adhoc ud32 scripts to make TMIB
calls.

It provides a simple object-oriented Perl interface to the Tuxedo MIBs
allowing the caller to query, add or update the various components of the
Tuxedo environment, such as servers, groups, access points etc.

See the "Changes" file for details of what has changed in this version.
