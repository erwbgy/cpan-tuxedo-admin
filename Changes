Revision history for Perl extension Tuxedo::Admin.

0.0.8  Mon Jun 30 00:06:21 BST 2003
  - Fixed showstopper bug in the _fields() method of a lot of classes - the
    "exists" field was incorrectly included resulting in an invalid TA_EXISTS
    field being sent.  Added a debug() method to Admin.pm and ud32.pm that
    allows tracing of input and output buffers to be turned on and off - very
    useful for debugging and if you're a bit paranoid (as you should be :-).
    ImportedResource.pm now works - added some tests for this.  More
    documentation fixes.

0.0.7  Sun Jun 29 16:26:21 BST 2003
  - Version 0.07 is a clean-up and documentation release, and more test cases
    have been added.  It has still only been tested against Tuxedo 8.1, but I
    plan to ensure that it works against at least Tuxedo 6.5 and up.  There
    are some examples under the t/ directory and in the documentation.

0.06  Wed Jun 25 23:54:13 2003
  - The main reason for this release is to have a working 'make test', so that
    the cpan-testers don't get failed builds.  I'm busy reworking the API so
    that only the parameters required to do a GET are mandatory for the new
    function, rather that all the required parameters for creating a new
    object.  I'm also ensuring that all objects have an exists() method.  More
    documentation is provided, but it is still incomplete and probably
    inaccurate in places.

0.05  Mon Jun 21 23:11:53 2003
  - Version 0.05 is the first public release.  It is not fully-functional, but
    is useful for some tasks, particularly those involving groups and servers.
    The API is not stable and is likely to change based on experience using
    the various modules.  Only tested against Tuxedo 8.1, but I plan to ensure
    that the library works with at least Tuxedo 6.5 and up.  'make test' does
    not currently work, but there are some examples under the t/ directory.
